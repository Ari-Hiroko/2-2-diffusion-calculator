# Description
This project implements a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) designed to perform discrete arithmetic reasoning within a $2 \times 10$ pixel constraint. By representing numbers and operators as $2 \times 2$ binary glyphs, the "LogicDiffuser" architecture combines a CNN for local spatial feature extraction with a high-capacity MLP bottleneck to bridge the gap between generative image patterns and formal algebraic logic. The system treats mathematical calculation as a conditioned inpainting task: the input equation is held as a fixed boundary condition, while the $2 \times 4$ result region is iteratively denoised from Gaussian noise to its logically consistent state, utilizing coordinate embeddings to distinguish between operand and result segments.
# Motivation
This project was built purely for fun. There is a certain poetic absurdity in using a sophisticated, multi-step Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model just to calculate basic decimal arithmetic that a 1970s pocket calculator could handle instantly. It is an intentionally "over-engineered" experiment—using a complex generative process to output a tiny $2 \times 10$ pixel result is objectively inefficient, which is precisely what makes it a compelling "weird inspiration."
